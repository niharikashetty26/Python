HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. 
It provides the structure and content of a web page by using elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style the HTML elements, defining how they should be displayed on the web page. 
It controls aspects like layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.

JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to web pages. 
It allows you to create dynamic content, handle user interactions, validate forms, and much more.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): HTTP is the protocol used for transmitting data over the web. 
It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between the client (web browser) and the server (where the website is hosted).

Web Servers: Web servers are software applications that handle client requests and serve web pages to users over the internet. 
Popular web servers include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.

Web Browsers: Web browsers are software applications that retrieve and render web pages. 
Examples include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge.

Domain Name System (DNS): DNS translates domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses that web servers can understand. 

This allows users to access websites using human-readable names instead of numeric IP addresses.

Web Hosting: Web hosting involves storing and serving website files on servers that are accessible over the internet. 

Hosting services provide the infrastructure and technologies necessary to make websites available online.

Responsive Web Design: With the proliferation of various devices (desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets), responsive web design ensures that websites adapt and display correctly on different screen sizes and resolutions.

Security: Web security is crucial for protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access. Techniques such as HTTPS (HTTP Secure), SSL/TLS encryption, and secure authentication methods help ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over the web.

Receiving Requests: When a user types a web address (URL) into their browser or clicks on a link, 
the browser sends a request to the server hosting the website. This request is typically made using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.

Routing the Request: The server receives the request and determines how to handle it based on factors like the requested URL, parameters, headers, etc. 
The server might need to process the request itself or pass it to another server or application for processing.

Processing the Request: If the request requires processing on the server-side (e.g., retrieving data from a database, executing code), 
the server performs those tasks. This could involve fetching content from files, databases, or other sources, processing the data, and generating a response.

Generating a Response: Once the server has processed the request, it generates a response to send back to the client (the user's web browser).
The response typically includes the requested content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.), along with relevant HTTP headers like status codes, content type, caching directives, etc.

Sending the Response: The server sends the response back to the client over the internet. It uses the HTTP or HTTPS protocol to transmit the data. 
The response travels through various network layers, routers, and switches until it reaches the client's device.

Receiving and Rendering: The client's web browser receives the response and begins to interpret it. It parses the HTML content to understand the 
structure of the web page, applies CSS styles to control the presentation, and executes any JavaScript code for interactivity or dynamic content.

Displaying the Web Page: Finally, the web browser renders the web page based on the received content and displays it to the user.
The user can then interact with the page, click on links, submit forms, and perform other actions, leading to additional requests and responses between the client and server.
